1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
HTTP 1 (Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 1) is the original version of the HTTP protocol, which is used for 
communication between web servers and clients, such as web browsers. HTTP 1.0 was introduced in 1996, and HTTP 1.1 was 
introduced in 1999.HTTP 1.0 uses a simple request-response model, where a client sends a request to a server, and the 
server sends a response back to the client. 

1.It works on the textual format.
2.There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.
3.It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages.
4.It compresses data by itself.

HTTP/2 (Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 2) is an updated version of the HTTP protocol, which was introduced in 2015. 
It was designed to address some of the limitations and performance issues of HTTP/1.1 and improve the speed and efficiency 
of web communication.

1.It works on the binary protocol.
2.It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
3.It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
4.It uses HPACK for data compression.

2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
------------------
The primitive data types in Javascript are string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint.
These hold only one value and does not have any properties or methods.
Objects in Javascript can contain many values. 
The values are written as key value pairs are called properties.
We can also create a new Object as below.

Example:
const person = new Object();
person.firstName = "John";
person.lastName = "Doe";
person.age = 50;
person.eyeColor = "blue";
	(or)
const person = {
firstName:"John", 
lastName:"Doe", 
age:50,
eyeColor:"blue"
};

We can access the property of the object as below
person.firstName, person.lastName, person.age, person.eyeColor

We can add new property to an existing object by giving it a value.
person.nationality = "English";

We can delete a property from an existing object by using keyword delete.
delete person.age;
